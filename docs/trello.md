# Trello

We use trello as our project management software.
To get access, you need to be invited to the project by either Kirk, Erik, or Kal.

Once in, you can see the list of cards. We currently have 2 different types of cards:

1. User Stories. These are cards that represent a feature or function of the application from the perpective of a class of user.
2. Tasks. These are cards that represent direct (imperative) work that the team will do.

The user stories are used to capture the acceptance criteria for features of the application. Esentially, they allow you to determine whether you've completed a portion of the application properly.
User stories are given the "User Story" label in Trello, and appear with a blue dash of color.

The tasks are used to signify actual work that will be done. Tasks are how we complete user stories. When we complete all of the tasks for a user story, then we can say we've completed that story.

We also have four different "buckets" that the cards live in. These buckets represent the lifecycle of a task/user story.
For example, tasks that are planned to be worked on are in the "Backlog" list, tasks that are currentlyt being worked on are in the "In Progress" list, etc.

We can freely move tasks and user stories to and from these lists at will. They are just a way to keep our heads focused on what's next to work on.

Here's an overview of each of the lists:

1. "Backlog". This list stores all of the tasks and stories that are planned. When planning work, all tasks and stories start here.
2. "In Progress". This list stores things that are currently being worked on. In addition to being in the "In Progress" list, most tasks will also have links to the branch in Github that the work is being done on. This helps with transparency and knowing how to get to a certain feature's code. A task can be linked to multiple branches if preferred, so bug fixes can also be linked to the original task.
3.  "Under Review". This list stores things that have been completed, but need to be tested for the expected functionality. Usually this means assigning another person to the card as a reviewer and letting them test the stuff. For small tasks this can be skipped, but for user stories it is definitely preferable to have someone test them.
4. "In Master". This list stores all of the things that have been completed. In addition to the testing from the "Under Review" list, for a task to be "In Master" the branch for the work needs to have been merged into the "master" branch on Github.
